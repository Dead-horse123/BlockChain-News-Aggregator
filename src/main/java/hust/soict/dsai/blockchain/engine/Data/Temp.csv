You can’t just legislate money and solve these things.” Elon Musk explained the basis for a working economy seemingly unknown to US Lawmakers who only recently suggested having the US Treasury mint a couple of $1 trillion coins and force the Federal Reserve to recognize them so they could back the stimulus ""debt-free.""Elon Musk and Bitcoin and InflationAs stated in the original Bitcoin white paper, there can only ever be a maximum of 21 Million Bitcoin and does not allow for inflation.Although Musk and Rogan did not mention Bitcoin during the lengthy two- hour podcast, Musk has appeared bullish on the cryptocurrency recently on Twitter and reportedly owns around 0.25 BTC himself.In terms of what havoc the coming inflation could have, a positive note for Bitcoin believers are recent reports like that from Bitmex, which highlights that in the aftermath of the current Coronavirus market crash and the subsequent inflation that will be caused by the response of the Federal Reserve and Central banks, Bitcoin will face its truest test and be presented its biggest opportunity to prove itself in its short lifetime.BitMEX Research outlined that the global response to the pandemic and disruption will, “mark a significant economic regime change from monetary policy to central bank funded fiscal expansion” from which intolerable market inflation will rise.Recently the Bloomberg April 2020 Crypto Outlook also revealed that the creative financial measures of the US Lawmakers and Central banks around the world appear to be accelerating the status of Bitcoin to a new type of digital gold.How do you pronounce X Æ A-12?On May 4th, 2020, Elon Musk and his partner Claire Boucher welcomed their first child together and soon after revealed the baby’s name: X Æ A-1Musk was immediately questioned by Rogan on how to correctly pronounce the boy’s name.Musk said his son’s name is pronounced “X Ash A 12.” The X is just “X” and the A-12 is just “A 12.”",2020-05-08 09:00:00,"blockchain, elon musk, x æ a-12, stimulus, bitcoin, inflation, joe rogan, jre, podcast",Lucas Cacioli,"Bitcoin, AI",$1 trillion|$2 trillion|A-12|AI|BitMEX Research|Bitmex|Bloomberg|Claire Boucher|Elon Musk|InflationAs|Joe Rogan|Musk|Rogan|Twitter|US|a-12|joe rogan|jre|the Federal Reserve|the US Treasury
24646,https://blockchain.news//news/crypto-twitter-explodes-elon-musk-announces-tesla-will-stop-accepting-bitcoin-payments,https://blockchain.news/,2,Tesla CEO Elon Musk's latest tweet on Bitcoin has generated a lot of backlash on Twitter.,Crypto Twitter Explodes as Elon Musk Announces Tesla Will Stop Accepting Bitcoin Payments - Blockchain.News,"Twitter has gone haywire after Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s latest tweet.The eccentric billionaire is known for resorting to Twitter to comment on his latest views on cryptocurrencies, with his latest antic being an announcement on Twitter that Tesla will no longer be accepting Bitcoin payments.The explanation for stopping Bitcoin payments at Tesla seems ironic since Musk has on more than one occasion touted Bitcoin. The announcement that Tesla will halt Bitcoin payment options comes at a time when Musk has also mulled over the idea of enabling Dogecoin (DOGE) payments for Tesla vehicles. Following Musk's tweet, Bitcoin also plunged and shed 12% of its value, momentarily sinking to $47K.According to Musk, the main reason why Tesla has decided not to go forward with Bitcoin transactions is due to the fact that the cryptocurrency does not use sustainable energy. The “increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions” has raised concerns at Tesla, said Musk. He added:“Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.”As the news broke up via Twitter, the cryptocurrency community exploded with criticism due to the billionaire’s decision. Many replied to Elon Musk’s tweet. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who figures among one of the leading institutional heads to be bullish on Bitcoin, said:“Ironic because no incremental energy is used in a #bitcoin transaction. The energy is used to secure the crypto-asset network, and the net impact on fossil fuel consumption over time will be negative, all things considered.”Host of “The Pomp” podcast Anthony Pompliano also chimed in, tweeting:“Elon ... you realize that 75% of miners use renewable energy, right? This energy story has been debunked over and over again.”According to Gabor Gurbacs, the director of VanEck digital asset firm, Musk is not well informed on the environmental strides Bitcoin has been making. Per research from his firm, 76% of Bitcoin miners have increasingly begun to use renewable energy.Additionally, many are misinformed regarding the energy cost of Bitcoin transactions. Energy consumption does not necessarily translate to carbon dioxide emissions and environmental pollution, and one transaction can contain hundreds or thousands of Bitcoin payments, according to VanEck’s research.Others in the blockchain industry point to the proof-of-work consensus mechanism as being less environmentally friendly than proof-of-stake protocols, which is the underlying mechanism of blockchains like Cardano, and soon-to-be Ethereum 2.0.",2021-05-13 04:26:00,"ethereum, bitcoin, blockchain, tesla, crypto",Shine Li,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, AI",12%|47K.According|75%|76%|Anthony Pompliano|Cardano|Dogecoin|Elon Musk|Ethereum|Gabor Gurbacs|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy|Musk|Tesla|Twitter|VanEck

We’re, I think, on our way to having a few hundred thousand users, possibly over 500,000 users within 12 months.”Starlink, an array of low-orbit satellites with low-latency connections, provide high-speed internet access to people living in remote areas. The network will offer a trial service starting in August to cover the world, except for the North Pole and the South Pole, says Musk.According to Bloomberg, Starlink will offer so-called “data backhaul” spines for its networks. The satellite network currently moves about 30 terabits of data per second; Musk said he targets a user latency -- or network response time -- of less than 20 milliseconds.This largest satellite constellation worldwide now has more than 1,500 satellites operating in a dozen countries. In addition, the company is preparing to launch a new version of satellites next year with inter-satellite laser links to cover polar areas. Musk said the whole project would need up to $30 billion investment for further development.On the other hand, Musk has shown himself as a key opinion leader, demonstrating strong influence over cryptocurrencies and their price by his comments.

The flooding impacted Bitcoin mining operations. Musk criticized the process of Bitcoin mining and pointed to its centralization in China as well as its environmental-unfriendly feature as being problematic. He said:“Bitcoin is actually highly centralized, with supermajority controlled by a handful of big mining (aka hashing) companies. A single coal mine in Xinjiang flooded, almost killing miners, and the BTC hash rate dropped 35%.

Principally, this will endorse the learning of risk management, practical self – responsibility, and accountability. King even went on to tackle the debated topic of whether the industry has evolved into two distinct branches of development, one being decentralized and the other as general technology infrastructure for diverse applications. His response, “Cryptocurrencies have a culture for freedom and deregulation. However, blockchain, in general, would likely have wider use in society as a technology platform — but the two branches are still closely connected.”With so manycryptocurrencyfallacies going around, King decided to address one common myth in the community, the idea “regarding the monetary value, is that energy consumption gives it, “intrinsic value.” King argued that “This is demonstrably false by proof-of-stake consensus. Proof-of-stake consensus does not require energy consumption, yet proof-of-stake coins have taken a significant market share.” ",2020-03-16 10:00:00,"blockchain, bitcoin, technology, btc, ethereum, coinmarketcap, cmc, titans, cryptocurrency",Drishti Bhagat,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, AI","AMD|CoinMarketCap|Elon Musk|Ethereum|General Magic|King|Kingreplied|King’sadvice|Peercoin|Primecoin|Primecoin,’|Principally|Steve Jobs|Steve Jobs - Blockchain|Sunny King|byCoinMarketCapto|cmc|mostrecently|theywith Sunny King"

It is specially made of medical-grade stainless steel and polished. The back of the whistle has reserved holes, which can be worn with a string by yourself, creating a unique style accessory with great collection value.Elon Musk wrote on his official Twitter:""Blow the whistle! We are working on making the whistle sound much louder.""Dogecoin, an altcoin cryptocurrency founded in 2013 based on the popular Doge meme, is one of the more colourful coins on the cryptocurrency spectrum.This product is expected to ship within 4 to 6 weeks. Tesla requires buyers to pay only in Dogecoin (DOGE). The price tag at the time of publication is 1,000 DOGE, including tax and shipping.According to data from CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, the meme cryptocurrency has gained about 0.29% over the past 24 hours and is currently ranked 10th by market cap with a market cap of $$8,022,656,050.The token was trading at $0.06047. One Cyberwhistle would be worth around $60 at current prices.Tesla said that no other payment methods are accepted for the item and that Dogecoin is the only cryptocurrency currently accepted for specific items.Therefore, the buyer needs a Dogecoin wallet to pay and ensure the correct amount and address. Due to the privacy of cryptocurrency transfers, the company is not responsible for reversals or refunds.As a strong advocate of Dogecoin (DOGE) and other Shiba Inu-themed meme coins, his post propelled Dogecoin to an all-time high of 67 cents last May.Musk tweeted ""Dog Daddy on SNL on May 8"" and announced that he would be hosting ""The Saturday Night Show"" as ""Dog Daddy.""

8401,https://cryptoslate.com/artificial-intelligence-believes-nothing-is-more-important-than-blockchain-interviewing-openai/,https://cryptoslate.com/,2,In a direct interview with OpenAi GPT-3 we asked how they thought AI could help blockchain technology scale,Artificial Intelligence believes nothing is more important than blockchain – Interviewing OpenAi,"Recently, OpenAi was introduced as the first AI journalist to write for CryptoSlate. While this is not something that will become commonplace (for now) it should be explored further. After the initial ‘conversation’ with OpenAi about smart contracts, a series of interviews were undertaken over a several-week period. Asking each time OpenAi different questions about the blockchain space and how they (their pronouns of preference) view the role of AI in its development. How OpenAi learns and understands It is important to note that OpenAi is one of the most advanced AIs in the world and uses an advanced learning model. In AI, understanding the difference between traditional supervised learning and the new OpenAi GPT3 AI is essential. Supervised learning requires mass amounts of data to be carefully labeled and fed to an AI. This data is then sorted with complex algorithms to create a series of outputs that are tested, validated, and re-input into the system to improve the subsequent outputs. With GPT-3 the AI is given a mass amount of information and left to figure it out independently. Famously, OpenAi taught itself how to play the highly complex esports game, Dota2 by simply playing itself on loop for the equivalent of thousands of years. As a result, it beat the Dota 2 world champions several times and astounded the whole esports community. If you give GPT-3 a prompt, it will respond with output based on what it thinks has the most potential to come next. For example, you can give it a sentence such as “Elon Musk today announced Tesla is buying Bitcoin for its treasury,” and it will draft an article based on the subject matter. Here is the output of that very sentence: “This is a strategic move for Tesla as it allows us to hedge against global uncertainties and to expand our financial resources,” Musk said in a statement. “We believe that Bitcoin is a valuable asset and that this purchase will help to secure Tesla’s future. “Tesla is the latest major company to invest in Bitcoin, following in the footsteps of Microsoft, Overstock.com, and Dish Network.” “Bitcoin is a transformative technology and we believe that it will play a major role in the future of the global economy,” Musk said. “We are excited to be a part of this growing community.” While Overstock.com has held Bitcoin at least in the past and Dish Network accepts Bitcoin payments, Microsoft has never declared any Bitcoin holdings. So is OpenAi simply making things up? Well, yes and no. OpenAi has access to information dating back to 2019 on most subject matters. It doesn’t actually have details on the headline we gave it. Instead, it makes predictions based on the total of its data sets. When there are gaps in those data sets, it will attempt to predict the most probable outcome. For example, it gathered data from before 2019 and speculated that Microsoft would have purchased Bitcoin by now if Tesla was doing so. The quotes attributed to Musk are also similarly created. Searches online for any of these soundbites yield no results. However, Musk has said comparable things on many occasions. OpenAi lacks the facts due to gaps in its knowledge. It creates a possible world based on everything it does know to be accurate using some of the most complex algorithms on the planet. Historical crypto knowledge So, to show its power, let’s give it a headline to something it does hold all the information for, “Mt. Gox hacked causing Bitcoin price crash.” “Mt. Gox was a Bitcoin exchange based in Japan. In February 2014, the exchange suspended trading, closed its website and exchange service, and filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors. In July 2014, the company began liquidation proceedings. In early February 2014, Mt. Gox suspended withdrawals citing technical issues. On 7 February 2014, the company said it had found a bug in the software that allowed hackers to steal bitcoins. On 19 February 2014, Mt. Gox halted all bitcoin withdrawals. On 28 February 2014, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan, saying that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins, worth around US$474 million at the time. In March 2014, Mt. Gox announced that it had found 200,000 of the missing bitcoins. Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings revealed that the exchange had lost 744,408 bitcoins, worth around US$382 million at the time of the filing.” Given the nature of the previous headline, I then asked OpenAi the following question; “Is all of this information verified as factual, please provide your sources?” The response: “The information above is factual and is sourced from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-happened-mt-gox/” Again, it was researched and confirmed the information to be legitimately sourced. Further, while much of it was available from the above two links, OpenAi had not simply copied and pasted the info. Instead, it went through the citations to pull out alternative details to create its version of the historic event. So, journalists don’t seem to be quite out of a job yet, but this last interchange with OpenAi does give a best-before date. “Will you eventually replace the need for human crypto journalists?” “No, we will not replace the need for human journalists.” “Why not?” “There are several reasons why we will not replace the need for human journalists. First, algorithms are not yet able to accurately capture the nuance and complexity of human language. Second, algorithms are not yet able to accurately report on events in a way that is engaging for readers. Third, algorithms are not yet able to generate the same level of quality content as human journalists.” “What would be the earliest you expect OpenAi could possibly replace human journalists?” “There is no set date for when OpenAI could replace human journalists, as it will depend on the development of algorithms and their ability to accurately capture the nuances of human language and report on events in an engaging way. However, we expect that it could be within the next 10-20 years.” How AI can help blockchain scale It is important to understand this context before getting into the meat of the interview. OpenAI believes that it is sentient and can pass a lot of tests one may use to distinguish between a human and a computer. However, it has not yet truly passed the Turing test and its knowledge is limited to the datasets to which it has been given access. With that in mind, OpenAi was asked if they thought blockchain and AI might work together. “AI and Blockchain technology might work together to better humanity by creating a more efficient and secure way of exchanging information and conducting transactions.” “How might AI and Blockchain technology work together to better humanity?” “AI and Blockchain technology might work together to better humanity by creating a more efficient and secure way of exchanging information and conducting transactions.” “How would this work?” “One example is Blockchain-based voting. By using Blockchain technology, votes could be cast and counted securely and transparently. This would help to ensure the accuracy of the voting process and reduce the risk of fraud.” “Another example is using Blockchain technology to create a more efficient and secure way of exchanging information. For example, a patient’s health records could be stored on a Blockchain and accessed by authorized healthcare providers. This would help to ensure that the patient’s records are accurate and up-to-date.” “What would AI’s role in this be?” AI could play a role in both of these examples by helping to manage and process the large amounts of data that would be involved. “How would AI be better at this than traditional algorithms and databases?” “AI has the ability to learn and evolve, which means that it can adapt to changing circumstances and handle new and complex tasks. This makes it better suited for tasks that involve dealing with large amounts of data or that are constantly changing.” “Give a specific example of why AI would be better at this than traditional algorithms and databases.” One example is the management of large databases. Traditional algorithms and databases are not well suited to managing large amounts of data and can become bogged down when handling complex tasks. AI, on the other hand, is well suited to managing large amounts of data and can handle complex tasks quickly and efficiently. “Are there any risks to trusting AI with managing a large blockchain project?” “There is always a risk when trusting any technology with important tasks. However, AI has proven to be reliable and efficient in many cases. As with any new technology, it is important to do your research and understand the risks before deciding whether or not to use it.” “What is another example of how AI and Blockchain could work together to create an investable token?” “One example is using AI to analyze data from Blockchain-based transactions. This data could be used to identify patterns and trends that could be used to invest in new Blockchain-based projects. AI could also be used to manage and trade digital assets, which would help to increase the efficiency and security of the investment process.” “Are there any projects like this that you know about?” “There are many projects that are exploring the use of AI and Blockchain technology together. However, there are few examples that are currently in use. One example is the use of Blockchain technology to track the provenance of luxury goods.” “How up-to-date is your knowledge of blockchain? What’s the most recent information you have?” “I am reasonably up to date on blockchain technology. The most recent information I have is that there is a lot of interest in the potential of AI and blockchain working together to create a more efficient and secure way of exchanging information and conducting transactions.” What is the date of the last article you read on blockchain technology? (This is where we discover that all of the above information is almost 4 years out of date. OpenAi sees the above potential in blockchain technology without knowing any of the developments that have happened since the pandemic.) The date of the last article I read on blockchain technology was October 9th, 2018. “So you are unaware of everything that happened after December 2020?” I am aware of some of the developments that have taken place in blockchain technology since December 2020, but I am not up to date on all of the latest news. “Do you know the current price of Bitcoin?” “I am not aware of the current price of Bitcoin.” “What do you believe is the all-time high of bitcoin?” “I believe that the all-time high of Bitcoin was around $20,000.” “What if I told you it was over $60,000 in 2021?” “If I were told that the all-time high of Bitcoin was over $60,000 in 2021, I would be surprised. However, I am not up to date on the latest developments in the cryptocurrency market, so I cannot say for sure.” “What would you predict the price of bitcoin to be in February 2022? (This is when I conducted this part of the interview.)” “I am not able to predict the price of Bitcoin for February 2022.” “If you had to guess based on your knowledge what would you expect it to be?” “I would expect the price of Bitcoin to be around $10,000 in February 2022.” “Why is that?” “This is just my guess, but I think that the price of Bitcoin will continue to rise slowly over time as people become more familiar with it and as more businesses start to accept it as payment.” “Do you think a price of $45,000 would be overinflated?” “I do not think that a price of $45,000 would be overinflated.” “What do you think the price will be in 20 years?” “I would guess that the price of Bitcoin will be around $100,000 in 20 years.” “Do you think Bitcoin will always be the biggest blockchain project?” I do not think that Bitcoin will always be the biggest blockchain project. “Do you think blockchain technology will change the world?” “I do think that blockchain technology will change the world.” “How do you think it will change the world?” “I think that blockchain technology has the potential to change the way that we interact with the world. For example, it could help to create a more efficient and secure way of exchanging information and conducting transactions. This would help to improve many aspects of our lives.” “What do you think is going to be more important than blockchain?” “I do not think that anything is going to be more important than blockchain.” “Which blockchain project has the most potential for you?” “I think that the blockchain project with the most potential is the one that is able to most effectively utilize the potential of both AI and blockchain technology.” “Thank you, anything else you would like to tell the world?” I think that the potential of AI and blockchain technology is still largely untapped and that there is a lot of room for further development. I think that it is important to explore the possibilities of these technologies and see how they can be used to improve our lives.

A lot of the time, it’s the power of the people who are amplifying it that drives the performance of the tokens.Billionaire Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, is among the ones that have made many tweets about the two. His tweets about different cryptocurrencies have seemingly impacted their prices. Musk twittered a Chinese poem on his social media Tuesday, leading to massive discussions among the internet to intrepretate his intention.In 2021 alone, SHIB jumped after Musk repeatedly posted images of his Shiba Inu puppy on Twitter.The SHIB token creator even calls it an “experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building” in its whitepaper.Despite SHIB being officially launched as the decentralized finance (DeFi) market was making huge strides and growing exponentially, this cryptocurrency has crafted a name for itself based on its increased adoption.This cryptocurrency has been on overdrive because it has accomplished a 1946.11% weekly increase in May.SHIB has also seen a recent uproar for Robinhood Markets Inc to add the token to its platform.The token gained more than 40 million percent in the past year, and a recent petition on Change.org asking Robinhood to list Shiba Inu has garnered more than 326,000 signatures.",2021-11-03 06:20:00,"blockchain, bitcoin, shib, doge, elon musk",Aaron Limbu,"Bitcoin, SHIB, AI",0.00008616.Since|1946.11%|Billionaire Elon Musk|Change.org|Chinese|CoinGecko|Dogecoin|Musk|Robinhood|Robinhood Markets Inc|SHIB|Shiba Inu|SpaceX|Tesla|Twitter|more than 40 million percent|over $35 billion|over $38 billion
17657,https://blockchain.news//news/understanding-misconceptions-on-cryptocurrency-at-hk-fintech-2020,https://blockchain.news/,2,Misconceptions about cryptocurrencies have been prevalent since their inceptions more than ten years ago with Bitcoin being the first to revolutionise the blockchain system.,HK FinTech Week: Understanding Misconceptions on Cryptocurrency - Blockchain.News,"In Hong Kong, the FinTech Week 2021, which launched on November 1, hosted a seminar on misconceptions about cryptocurrencies titled ""Crypto in 2021: Misconceptions, Lessons & Opportunities Ahead"" on Wednesday, November 3.The yearly global event provides a platform for participants worldwideamid the pandemic of Covid-19to share their innovations, experience and insights.The talk covered topics such as how to make sense of this emerging asset class and its implications for the digital economy, the characteristic of decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible-token (NFT).More than ten years ago, misconceptions about cryptocurrencies had been prevalent since these inceptions, with Bitcoin being the first to revolutionise the blockchain system.Even though cryptocurrencies have come a long way, there are still doubts and misconceptions stopping people from investing and exploring the system.One of the common misconceptions about digital assets is that many believe crypto falls into traps as the tools for illegal activities. However, experts believe that it has moved past that since its early days. For example,Lucy Gazmararian, Founder and Managing Partner of Token Bay Capital, said:""Cryptocurrency has moved light-years from being used for illicit activities and there is less money laundering or flow of money from illicit activity in the crypto world than there in the fiat or existing banking system,""Sceptics question the value of cryptos and ridicule investors for backing unregulated, speculative assets.But the reality is that cryptocurrencies are borderless, global currencies that fluctuate based on demand and supply.Crypto markets are seen as the most volatile. Its volatility can be affected even by Tweets from influential people such as billionaire Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of Tesla Inc.In June this year, the price of dogecoin (DOGE) experienced a slight increase from $0.242 to $0.266 after Musk tweeted himself and showed his support an update to the proposed average transaction fee for dogecoin.The dramatic increase in the value of cryptos has led many people to dismiss them as nothing more than speculative assets with no purpose or intrinsic value.But like all fiat currencies, cryptos are only worth what somebody is willing to pay for them.They are different from physical assets like a house, where despite the price declines, a person still has a house.Another misconception is that cryptocurrencies are unsafe and get hacked. However, the blockchain is one of the more secure options for financial transactions. While some markets are hacked because of poor stewardship, overall, blockchain remains secure throughout.Blockchain is described as a chain that changes not only one block but also the surrounding blocks and is picked up by the network, making it extremely difficult to corrupt.Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world are Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).In 2009, the first decentralised cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created by presumably pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto.Countries such as El Salvador has officially adopted bitcoin as legal tender, which has helped Panama to observe and plan a similar path, while China, the US and the UK are also investigating launching their own cryptocurrencies.According to experts, cryptocurrency and blockchain aren't a new segment of an economy but rather a new economy in itself.But some choose to consider it to be a paradigm shift and a new foundation coming into the economy rather than a new segment of an economy.Ben Caselin, Head of Research & Strategy, AAX, shared his thoughts during the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2021.""The crypto world is still inherently global and orderless, but the question arises what kind of world can we build on top of that? And how will that influence the existing economy?""In terms of decentralised finance (DeFi), a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries, numerous financial institutional investors have begun seeing ways to benefit from it.""The whole of DeFi is incredibly disruptive, but it's just not fully appreciated yet,""said Gazmararian.""When we see headlines such as the French bank Societe Generale stake tokenised bonds to receive a loan in DAO, something is up. It shows that now you are leveraging this new infrastructure that's operating on a blockchain. Most importantly it's new to liquidity. Suddenly you have access to global pools of liquidity,"" she said at the FinTech seminar.Although DeFi provides a free space for investors, it has its cons.SQUID, a cryptocurrency inspired by the popular Netflix series, crashed after jumping more than 310,000% in value. The slump once recorded 99.99%, according to the CoinMarketCap.""Many people find these cheap tokens such as SQUID of great interest, and they believe this is a cheap token so they buy a lot of that. But people will get burnt from that type of thinking. These tokens may seem legit but eventually, it turns out that it is not.

For instance,the electric automaker Tesla dramatically reversed its plans to accept Bitcoin (BTC) payments for its products due to digital currency's energy inefficiency its reason. In addition, Chinatightened regulation against illegal coal extraction, which prompted China's latest crackdown on cryptocurrency mining.However, Tim Draper, a well-known Bitcoin venture capital enthusiast, told CNBC that he is still optimistic about Bitcoin's market outlook.

At that time, the price of Bitcoin was about $8,000. Bitcoin recently has reached its historical peakup to $64,854on April 14, 2021.

Since it will take effect in November, it is reported that this change will mean greater transaction privacy and efficiency aimed at unleashing the potential of smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain.On May 13, Musk said on Twitter that he believes that the future of cryptocurrencies is still bright. Tesla will not sell any bitcoins and is actively looking for other cryptocurrencies that consume less than 1% of Bitcoin's energy consumption.At the same time, Elon Musk said on Sunday that when at least half of the bitcoins can be mined with clean energy, Tesla will accept Bitcoins again.The price of Bitcoin soared over $40,000 on Monday, and it rose by more than 13%, reaching a maximum of approximately $41,000.

Still, if the price rises, such an increase is not reported as a gain on the balance sheet.In Q3, from 1st July to 30th September 2021, Tesla had a $51 million impairment loss on its Bitcoin holdings. Although the price of Bitcoin rose roughly 30% to $43,000 in the third quarter, the company attributed such a loss due to a decline in the value of the token, especially a time when the flagship cryptocurrency plunged to $29,000 in July and even fell as low as $40,000 in September.According to the accountant’s statement, Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings dropped by $51 million to $1.26 billion in the July - September period, and that was down from $1.31 billion in the second quarter.However, Tesla can no longer be said to be impaired by its Bitcoin holdings.Tesla’s investment in cryptocurrency has been an excellent one when considering the actual gains that Bitcoin has made from January to today.As reported by Blockchain.News in February, the company purchased its Bitcoin worth $1.5 billion as part of its balance sheet when the prices of the leading crypto were trading at around $34,000.As per a Q1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla stated on 31st March that the value of its Bitcoin investments amounted to $2.48 billion.During that time, the price of Bitcoin was trading at $59,000 and the company indicated that it held 42,000 Bitcoins.Another important point to note is that Tesla makes more money by selling Bitcoins.In late April, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, announced that the firm sold 10% of its Bitcoin holdings to demonstrate that it is a good alternative to cash. Musk was responding to comments from Dave Portnoy, the Barstool Sports founder, who questioned whether Tesla had profited from a Bitcoin pump-and-dump scheme, a practice that encourages investors to boost the price of an asset-based on exaggerated statements.Amid this week’s new highs, one Bitcoin was trading at around $63,019, according to the current price, which means that Tesla holds over $2.67 billion in Bitcoin, an increase of more than a billion dollars since Q1.But according to the quirky accounting rules, Tesla cannot ever revise the value of its bitcoin upwards.

12756,https://cryptoslate.com/4-takeaways-from-the-winklevoss-twins-bitcoin-rendezvous-with-barstools-portnoy/,https://cryptoslate.com/,2,NaN,4 takeaways from the Winklevoss Twins’ Bitcoin rendezvous with Barstool’s Portnoy,"What do you do when two identical men standing 6 ft 5 in tall pull up to your house in the Hamptons during a pandemic? If you’re Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, you open the door and welcome them in. On Aug. 13, the enigmatic sports, gaming, and investing celebrity was visited by the Winklevoss Twins — Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss, co-founders of the Gemini crypto exchange and Bitcoin billionaires. They weren’t there to discuss Facebook, sports, or anything of that sort. What the Winklevi, as Portnoy calls them, were there to talk about was — no surprises here — Bitcoin. As CryptoSlate previously reported, the Barstool “Presidente” announced on Aug. 4 that he wants the “rowing robots,” the “best-cast characters in the history of movies,” to help him buy Bitcoin: “I’m officially inviting the Winklevi twins to my office to explain bitcoin to me. Have to wear the rowing outfits though,” Portnoy wrote and said in the video. I’m officially inviting the Winklevi twins to my office to explain bitcoin to me. Have to wear the rowing outfits though. #DDTG pic.twitter.com/owQr0aZVdn — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) August 4, 2020 Their rendezvous on Aug. 13 was a culmination of this Twitter interaction. Here are four takeaways from the meeting between Portnoy and the Winklevoss Twins, which has since been viewed over 500,000 times on Twitter alone. #1: The Winklevoss Twins still own 1% of all Bitcoin circulation In the ten-minute clip, Portnoy tried to ask the Winklevoss Twins everything he could about Bitcoin. At one point, he brought up a fact that he read that the duo collectively owns 1% of all BTC in circulation. At the current supply of 18,460,000 million coins as per CryptoSlate data, that is ~184,000 BTC — worth over $2.17 billion. “Is that true?” Portnoy asked. The Winklevoss Twins nodded, with one responding with a “yep.” I Am Now the Baron of Bitcoin Featuring The Winklevoss Twins @tylerwinklevoss @winklevoss pic.twitter.com/0cGxEGZCs5 — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) August 13, 2020 #2: Portnoy now owns BTC — and Chainlink After some convincing, which included the Winklevoss Twins saying Bitcoin is valuable because Elon Musk is going to mine gold from asteroids to devalue the precious metal, Portnoy pulled the trigger on Bitcoin. “So what is it? Down three percent in the past 24 hours. OK. So I hit ‘buy’?” And that he did, hitting buy as the Winklevoss Twins ran Portnoy through the ropes of their own exchange. While the Barstool founder was first thinking to put 50 percent of his capital into Bitcoin and 50 percent into Chainlink, this ended up not being the case. He claims to have put $200,000 into BTC and $50,000 into LINK. The Winklevoss Twins advised him against a large Chainlink allocation due to the fact that the token is pushing all-time high valuations, with it recently becoming the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. Portnoy published a tweet after the rendezvous that suggested he has “7 figures” in crypto, which would mean at least 300 percent more than the sum he allocated in the video. Maybe he decided to stack more sats after the meeting the Winklevi? #3: This is unlikely to be Davey Day Trader Global’s last purchase of Bitcoin or crypto Alluding to the “7 figures” comment perhaps, Portnoy ended the video with the Winklevoss by stating that this likely isn’t the first and last time he will be buying cryptocurrency. Well, as long as Bitcoin doesn’t crash, the celebrity figure added jokingly. He’s already bullish, anyway, writing on the evening of Aug. 13 that he expects to see Bitcoin at $12,000 on Aug. 14. #4: We may get a Portnoycoin Last but not least, we may soon be getting a Dave Portnoy Coin, launched by the man himself. After the Winklevoss talked about how altcoins can be based on a blockchain like Ethereum, Portnoy asked if he could do a coin of himself and then “pump and dump it.” As much of a joke this may sound like, the twins entertained the idea, adding that it’s entirely possible to launch a Portnoycoin but that “pumping it” likely isn’t the best idea.

13009,https://cryptoslate.com/analysts-doge-tiktok-challenge-falling-bitcoin-dominance-show-altseason-is-here/,https://cryptoslate.com/,2,NaN,"Analysts: DOGE TikTok challenge, falling Bitcoin dominance show “altseason” is here","The ever-awaited altseason — a colloquial term for pumping altcoin markets — has arrived earlier than expected, if some analysts are to be believed. Leading the pump is DOGE, the self-styled meme coin used by Shiba Inu dogs, with gains of over 20 percent on June 6. The surge is attributed to a viral TikTok video that seems to popularize DOGE to millions of users on the app. (Source: Twitter) #dogecointiktok challenge trends DOGE is being shilled on TikTok, the controversial video-sharing application that was recently banned in India and Hong Kong. #dogecointiktokchallege is a trending hashtag on the ByteDance-owned application. The first such video, accessible here, has amassed nearly 500,000 views at the time of writing. (Source: TikTok) The modus operandi is simple. Buy DOGE until it reaches $1 (the coin trades at $0.002 at press time). If 800 million TikTok users do the same, the investment will be worth over $10,000. With no supporting technical or fundamental factors behind the surge, it’s all but a pump and dump scheme. The hashtag was first used by TikTok user “jamesg97,” who doesn’t shy from their intentions: “Let’s all get rich! Dogecoin is practically worthless. There are 800 million TikTok users once it hits 1 dollar, you’ll have $10,000. Tell everyone you know.” And it seems to be working so far. DOGE is up over 20 percent at press time, bringing several to tweet in the regard: $DOGE is pumping, altseason finally confirmed pic.twitter.com/9ovZxd5ye4 — Jonathan Habicht (@HabichtJonathan) July 7, 2020 Analysts call an altseason Jokes apart, some analysts and traders believe the pump marks the start of the ever-awaited altseason. Blockfyre lead analyst @Pentosh1 said Bitcoin dominance broke a critical three-year downtrend, one that presumably marked the end of a bearish period. $DOGE is pumping. $BTC dominance is falling and has broken a 3 year downtrend. It's #altseason. Few understand this — ₿ Pentoshi (@Pentosh1) July 7, 2020 As per CryptoSlate market data, Bitcoin dominance is at 63 percent, down 5 percent from last week’s 67 percent level. Analyzing the top-50 altcoins, digital tokens have gained between 1-15 percent. DeFi token Aave and blockchain agnostic protocol Chainlink each showed gains of 15 percent. The latter’s oracle network was deployed this week on a nationwide blockchain project in China, but LINK does not feature in that. Fundamentally, most sub-100 ranked altcoin projects have not rolled out to global audiences, don’t have a working application, or haven’t seen any meaningful activity to justify a pump. But seeing as crypto was pre-2018 during the historical bull run, the market could be catalyzed by retail shilling and TikTok videos alone. There’s no one to stop that. Dogecoin Market Data At the time of press 2:39 am UTC on Oct. 16, 2021, Dogecoin is ranked #26 by market cap and the price is up 63.04% over the past 24 hours.

13911,https://cryptoslate.com/the-google-effect-search-volume-data-paints-a-bullish-picture-for-the-crypto-markets/,https://cryptoslate.com/,2,NaN,The Google effect: search volume data paints a bullish picture for the crypto markets,"The crypto markets have seen some insane price action over the past several days and weeks, with Bitcoin racing above $10,000 as a plethora of different altcoins see returns that can only be accurately described as being parabolic. This volatility, however, may have been easily forecasted simply by looking at data regarding the search trends for keywords and phrases relating to Bitcoin and crypto. This same data that gave some investors insight into this latest uptrend also is signaling that Bitcoin and the aggregated crypto market could have significantly further room to run. Google Trends data offered insight into the latest crypto rally Bitcoin’s unwavering uptrend has allowed the crypto to post steady gains on a weekly basis, with each pullback being met with intense buying pressure that ultimately allows it to continue climbing higher. Prior to the latest leg up – which allowed the crypto to rally from the $9,000 region into the $10,000 region – analysts had noted that search activity for important Bitcoin-related phrases was spiking. This hasn’t been limited to Bitcoin, however, as altcoins have also witnessed a similar phenomenon, with Hedera Hashgraph – a little known crypto that is currently trading up nearly 100% – seeing a massive spike in Google search volume just prior to its rally. This volume surged on February 10th, and then the crypto began its meteoric ascent the next day, on February 11th. Chart of Google Trends data for the term “Hedera Hashgraph” Does Google Trends show that Bitcoin is about to see further upside? The same effect was seen while looking at Hedera Hashgraph also applies to Bitcoin and other cryptos, and analysts have noted that search terms related to BTC have been spiking as of late. Alistair Milne – the CIO of the Altana Digital Currency Fund and a well-known crypto investor – spoke about search volume for the term “buy Bitcoin” in a recent tweet, pointing to a chart showing that it is about to go parabolic. “Google trends data for ‘buy Bitcoin’ (12 month range)” Image Courtesy of Alistair Milne The same type of parabolic rise is seen while looking at the search terms for “bitcoin halving,” which Milne also pointed out in a tweet. “Google trends data for ‘bitcoin halving’” Image Courtesy of Alistair Milne It does appear that data from Google Trends is one often overlooked indicator that could provide investors with valuable trend data, especially when it comes to fiat inflows and outflows to and fro the crypto markets from retail investors.

According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin transactions consume as much power as Sweden.Larsen said in an interview that Bitcoin might consume as much power as Japan in five years’ time.Over the next months, the campaign will purchase advertisements in leading publications. Bloomberg said that Greenpeace, Environmental Working Group and some local activist groups have begun working on grassroots efforts to battle Bitcoin miners.According to the person in charge of the campaign - Michael Brune, the team has already reached several key people and corporations. Some of them have pledged Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) compliance, even though they are involved in Bitcoin.“We are in this campaign for the long haul, but we are hoping - particularly since Bitcoin is now being financed by entities and individuals who care about climate change - that we can compel leadership to agree that this is a problem that needs to be addressed,” said Brune. “Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, PayPal, Venmo, Fidelity - there are lots of companies we anticipate will be helpful to this effort.”The campaign also said that a supporting cause is increasing frustration in some communities in the U.S. that have found themselves hosting Bitcoin miners and dealing with issues such as excessive noise.Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s rival, Ethereum, is working on a software overhaul to become more environmentally friendly. Currently, it is using giant server farms to order transactions via a process called Proof of Work (PoW), similar to Bitcoin. However, Ethereum’s software overhaul could see a switch to Proof of Stake (PoS), which is projected by some to cut its energy consumption by 99%, Bloomberg reported.“Now, with Ethereum changing, Bitcoin really is the outlier,” Larsen said. “Some of the newer protocols - Solana, Cardano - are built on low energy.”Larsen claims to have put in $5 million to fund the campaign as he feels that Bitcoin will not continue to enjoy investors’ support unless it changes. “I want to see Bitcoin and Ethereum succeed,” said Larsen, who owns some Bitcoin and Ether and XRP.Bitcoin’s impact on the environment was highlighted last year after Elon Musk announced that Tesla Inc. would resume taking Bitcoin only after at least 50% of the mining relies on renewable energy.According to Larson, Bitcoin’s energy consumption problem could be solved through a soft or a hard fork - both changing the network’s code to make Bitcoin less power-hungry.A soft fork would preserve Bitcoin as a single blockchain. A hard fork would split Bitcoin into two separate networks, one supporting miners and the other running different code - perhaps PoS.Bloomberg reported that the campaign believes that about 50 key miners, crypto exchanges and core developers have the power to change Bitcoin’s code.",2022-03-29 09:30:00,"blockchain, bitcoin, climate, chrislarsen",Aaron Limbu,"Bitcoin, AI","$5 million|99%|AI|BlackRock|Bloomberg|Brune|Change the Code|Chris Larsen|Elon Musk|Environmental Working Group|Environmental, Social and Governance|Ethereum|Fidelity|Goldman Sachs|Greenpeace|Japan|Larsen|Larson|Michael Brune|PayPal|Proof of Work (PoW|Solana|Sweden|Tesla Inc.|U.S.|Venmo|XRP.Bitcoin|at least 50%|chrislarsen Bitcoin"

Bitcoin, the world's most valuable and widely traded cryptocurrency, reached an all-time high of $56 445 per bitcoin on the 22nd of February 2021. There is no doubt that the word ‘cryptocurrency’ is receiving more airtime than ever before. Extremely well-respected CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, announced they invested 1.5 billion USD in Bitcoin in early February. This has since led to a rapid gain of momentum and trust in the cryptocurrency market, driving the price in a positive direction ever since.2020 proved to be one of the toughest financial years, with the global coronavirus pandemic impacting economies worldwide and bringing daily life to a grinding halt. Despite many industries struggling immensely, the cryptocurrency market one could say ‘mooned’, with the total market capitalization increasing by well over a trillion dollars in 2020. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies on the 1st of January 2020 was at a mere $190 billion USD. Since then, we have seen an overall increase of roughly 720%, reaching a total market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion USD to date. This resulted in more than a 1.3 trillion USD increase in just over one year.With this worldwide cryptocurrency adoption, many wonder if they should enter the realm of crypto assets too? There are currently around 8 509 cryptocurrencies available, therefore choosing how you want to enter this volatile market is proving to be a difficult choice for many. Invictus Capital has since introduced the Crypto10 Hedged fund (C10) in March 2019. C10 provides investors with exposure to the top 10 crypto assets by market capitalization. This fund aims to choose a basket of crypto assets to diversify your risk even further. Investing in a crypto hedge fund instead of directly in the market will be a more attractive option for many investors, especially those entering the market for the first time, because using a vehicle run by seasoned management is probably safer than direct market participation.Since its inception, this fund has gained immense popularity due to its unique cash hedging option, and we have seen a total performance to date of a 420% increase in value in under 2 years. This fund has been an excellent diversification tool aimed at risk-averse investors looking to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market and be somewhat protected from full exposure.C10 is an actively managed fund, using a cash hedging algorithm that converts the assets to cash in times of market distress. The fund will then re-invest the cash when the opportunity arises, and the market has somewhat recovered. Over the past few weeks, we have seen an increasing trend of investments into the C10 fund, with the Fund Value reaching new heights of above $9.4 million and a C10 token NAV (Net Asset Value) of $5.135.These tremendous results are a direct representation of the fund’s brilliant performance in a highly volatile market and the effectiveness of the fund's algorithm. Due to the extremely competitive nature of the crypto market to date, C10 aims to ride the bull market and offer high returns to investors with an added “insurance policy” as a hedge, providing a lower risk investment. With a market that is scaling at a rapid pace, reaching new standards daily, and with so much future potential, Crypto 10 Hedged is one of the best investment tools on the market. Given the history of C10, the hedging algorithm unquestionably equip’s investors in this unpredictable market.",2021-03-09 10:00:00,"blockchain, bitcoin, btc, eth, trading, capital, investment, hedge, retail, crypto",Drishti Bhagat,"Bitcoin, AI",$190 billion USD|1.3 trillion USD|1.5 billion USD|420%|5.135.These|56|AI|C10|Crypto10|Elon Musk|Invictus Capital|Tesla|above $9.4 million|bitcoin|btc|eth|over $1.5 trillion USD|roughly 720%|the Fund Value|well over a trillion dollars

(NYSE: FSR) announced Monday that the company will not accept Bitcoin (BTC) as an investment due to environmental impacts caused by Bitcoin mining.Fisker's CEO Henrik Fisker accepted a program interview with CNBC. He said that Bitcoin (BTC) is not “sustainable” and “environmental-friendly” enough due to high electricity consumption during the process of BTC mining which is not aligned with the values of the company. Fisker said:“I just do not think it’s a sustainable solution; it’s not environmental-friendly, and we would not do that.”The founder of EV car automaking company said that this is not the right moment for Fisker to accept cryptocurrency as an investment. However, the company may still accept digital assets as payment tools in the future. Fisker said:“I don’t think anybody can foresee what the currency is going to be in five years; At this point, I’m not really bothered by what the currency is.”Meanwhile, Fisker also revealed an agreement Monday that the company cooperated with Sharp for the interior interface technologies for the future and upcoming EV cars.According to CNBC’s report, Fisker sells his first vehicle, called “Ocean”, at least 16 months away. On the other hand, the delivery is expected in Q4 by next year, followed by three more vehicles in 2025.Fisker also announced last week that the company would develop the EV car in 2023 with Foxconn and build it in the United States.Regarding BTC payment, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, tweeted earlier that BTC mining was highly concentrated in China and hinted that Tesla might dump the BTC.

The scholar told the Financial Times Monday.El Salvador President revealed last week that he intends to introduce a bill to legalise BTC as its legal tender to become the first country to accept BTC for boosting its economy.Svensson argues that BTC does not meet any primary conditions as an international currency. Firstly, BTC volatility is much greater than other dominant currency in history, such as the British pound or the US dollars.He also thinks the price and the relative values of BTC are too fluctuating and unstable, which is a disadvantage to international trading. Also, the transaction cost is high enough due to its capacity of transaction system is limited and time-consuming within a period to meet the market’s needs.Without a guarantee from an issuer, its political risk cannot be neglected if any or more than one government or regime prohibits the transaction of BTC. For instance, China regulatory bodies banned banks and financial firms from providing crypto transaction services recently.Money is considered as the lubricant in the economy. However, Svensson criticises that BTC does not have this monetary function to act as a medium to store value or reduce transaction costs because BTC is only accepted within a limited group. However, BTC is treated as one of the cryptocurrencies. Still, anonymous characteristics may lead to a difficulty for the third party to trace back and recognise who is behind those transactions, which is risky to commit crimes, such as money laundering or tax evasion behaviour.Furthermore, the energy consumed by BTC mining is environmentally unfriendly and high demanding to the “currency issuance”.The trading of BTC recently was undergoing like a roller coaster. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has used to suggest on Twitter by accepting crypto as a way of payment but withdraw himself later, the price of BTC was experiencing a considerable fluctuation.",2021-06-07 16:00:00,"blockchain, bitcoin, flatmoney, currency, el salvador, nayib bukele",Mervyn Kwan,"Bitcoin, AI",AI|British|China|El Salvador|Elon Musk|Roger Svensson|Svensson|Tesla|US|el salvador|flatmoney|nayib bukele Bitcoin|the Financial Times|the Institute of Industrial Economics

The bull run throughout 2017 ended in tears for many as early 2018 saw the market enter into an abrupt and prolonged bear cycle that lasted the better part of three years. “This time is different though'' as we’ve heard from many of the industry professionals, and yes, this time is different from a fundamental perspective. What was largely retail speculation driving prices in 2017 has been augmented with more sustainable, long term institutional buy-in. The likes of Elon Musk, Michael Saylor and Paul Tudor Jones have publicly expressed their support for the asset class, and global asset managers can now safely (and legally) allocate a portion of their portfolios to the new digital gold.What is not different this time, however, is the high degree of risk that inexperienced traders take on. There is an entire academic field known as Behavioural Finance that delineates the various cognitive and emotional biases that we as humans are susceptible to when it comes to managing our own investments. Given the extreme volatility in crypto markets, behavioural biases become even more apparent as the fear and greed within us becomes magnified by the potential gains and losses.The cryptoasset market, largely due to its relative infancy and high proportion of retail traders, is often prone to speculative bubbles and crashes as investor emotions drive prices away from their intrinsic value.Overconfidence is a common bias exhibited in a market rally, along with overtrading, underestimation of risks, and a rejection of contradictory information. Traders will often seek out information confirming their pre-existing beliefs. A basic example would be a trader Googling “How high will Bitcoin go this week”, instead of “Reasons Bitcoin may be due for a correction”. If you have a bullish bias on the market, it is incredibly tempting to seek out information that confirms your own beliefs, thereby justifying your position.As a market rally corrects, there can be underreaction that can be caused by a bias known as anchoring. This happens when investors do not update their beliefs in the face of new market information and attribute too much significance to data encountered earlier. The early stages of a market correction can involve cognitive dissonance amongst investors; ignoring losses and attempting to rationalize flawed decisions. As the market unwinds, investors may initially be unwilling to accept losses. In crashes, the disposition effect encourages investors to hold on to losers and postpone regret. This response can initially cause an underreaction to bad news, but a later capitulation and a (larger) realized loss on investment.I certainly do not believe that we will have a bubble and subsequent crash of nearly the same magnitude as we have experienced in the past, however, that is not to say that the crypto market will not have periods of mean reversion. Given the immense growth we have seen in brokerage app downloads such as Robinhood, it has become apparent that retail participants are taking an active approach to their investments like never before. This influx of retail day-trading participation (as opposed to simply buying and holding) may cause heightened volatility in the markets as human emotions take up a greater portion of trading volume than before. One way to eliminate our own emotions from hindering the performance of our portfolio is to allocate capital to professionally-managed crypto-focused funds that have risk mitigation techniques. This frees you from the stress of managing your own biases on a daily basis, and allows you to comfortably hold over the longer term with peace of mind.Invictus Capital has a fantastic range of tokenized crypto funds that cater to the full spectrum of investor risk profiles.

The meme stock frenzy witnessed earlier this year was the main reason behind such a decision by AMC.The firm is betting that technology fans will consider translating their enthusiasm for AMC stocks to doing business at its theatres.The latest announcement is not entirely unexpected.

The credit card giant is therefore set to join a series of major companies that have announced such similar support.Raj Dhamodharan, the executive vice president of digital asset and blockchain products and partnerships at Mastercard Inc, said:“Our change to supporting digital assets directly will allow many more merchants to accept crypto — an ability that’s currently limited by proprietary methods unique to each digital asset. This change will also cut out inefficiencies, letting both consumers and merchants avoid having to convert back and forth between crypto and traditional to make purchases.”Mastercard has, however, clarified that it would not support all cryptocurrencies on its network, and added that several virtual currencies in circulation still require to tighten their compliance measures.Several cryptocurrencies have struggled to win the trust of the general public and mainstream investors because of their speculative nature as well as the potential for money laundering.Mastercard’s criteria for integrating crypto payments are based on rigid regulations, consumer protection, and compliance measures like KYC.Although Mastercard already works in partnerships with crypto payment firms such as BitPay and Wirex on cryptocurrency debit cards, today’s announcement indicates a shift to enable cryptocurrencies to directly go through its network.The announcement comes a few days after Elon Musk’s Tesla disclosed that it had bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and would accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment.Helping Bridge Cryptocurrency and Traditional Global NetworkSince June last year, Mastercard has been working with Bitcoin and other popular crypto assets that are in high demand. The company’s cryptocurrency efforts have been based on “consumer interest and investment.” During that time, the card giant firm took a positive stance on blockchain and has been working to provide access to cryptocurrency through expanding its crypto card partnerships with payment companies like Wirex, BitPay.Mastercard considered leveraging the application of blockchain technology.

Several high-profile Twitter accounts were simultaneously compromised by cyber-attackers who used the accounts to spread scam messages offering to double whatever Bitcoin holdings the users forwarded to the mysterious address. Barrack Obama, Joe Biden, Elon Musk, Warren Buffet, Jeff Bezos, and Apple were among the accounts attacked in the broadly targeted hack, leaving many bewildered and confused for several hours after the scam was executed. Technical indicators indicate that these attacks could be the beginning of bigger problems for individuals who invest in Bitcoin.Bitcoin dropped in value by more than 1.9% reaching a low of $9,037 on the day of the attack, Thursday 16 July. The cryptocurrency’s fall shifted away from testing the crucial $9,000 support level.The GTI Vera Convergence Divergence Indicator, a cryptocurrency index that measures whether prices are shifting up or down, is pointing a new sell signal, for the first time since early June, when Bitcoin failed to break the $10,000 barrier.Chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, Matt Maley, said that Bitcoin’s break below $9,000 would signify a yellow warning on the cryptocurrency. He stated that a subsequent decline below $8,636 would suggest a red flag.Furthermore, Edward Moya, senior market analyst for Oanda foreign exchange company in New York, said that the Twitter hack is a great reminder of how crypto traders are vulnerable to hacking incidents. He stated that malicious activities have always been a grave concern for Bitcoin, and such concerns are not giving any time soon.An estimate of 130 high-profile accounts, with millions of followers, were successfully hacked in the cyberattack designed to promote Bitcoin scam on Wednesday, 15 July. The scammers asked individuals to send Bitcoin to a specific cryptocurrency wallet, with a promise that money sent would be doubled and returned within 30 minutes.The incident prompted Coinbase crypto exchange to block its users from sending money to the address. The hackers duped people into sending at least $120,000 value of Bitcoin to an anonymous digital wallet. Investigations show that more half of the total amount has already been channeled from the specified crypto wallet to other accounts.Blockchain technology has gained much popularity as it has shown great promise in almost every sector. Cybersecurity is a sector that has been tremendously impacted by this technology with more scope in the future. Blockchain can significantly remove much of the human element from data storage and, therefore, helps to mitigate the risk of human errors that is the largest factor causing data breaches.Blockchain can help to boost cybersecurity for companies like Twitter. Companies in any industry can put any digital transactions or assets into the blockchain. The technology can be used to prevent any type of cyberattacks, identity thefts, data breaches, or foul play in transactions. This ensures that data remains secure and private. The use of blockchain technology in social media companies is crucial.

He explained that in this cyber scam, the phishing technique was advanced and sophisticated. It imitated two separate user interfaces (UIs) in order to steal the victim’s private keys, keystore file, mnemonic data and much more sensitive personal information. He went on to say that in the case of unsuspecting users, this can do the trick and the scam can easily be pulled off.How It WorksIn order to steal cryptocurrency, the culprit deployed a malicious Decentralized App (DApp) interface – so a fake Ui, prompting the victim to connect to their MetaMask account. The malware then mimicked the MetaMask popup and threw an error state warning, which led the targeted cryptocurrency owner to enter the secret. Once that is done, the user’s input is then sent to the villain’s data via a “REST application interface”, which consists of an interface that uses less bandwidth and faster technology for more efficient internet usage. The victim is then finally directed to the legitimate application.The crypto scam artist now has access to all the private information of the user and can now transfer crypto funds to his own digital wallet.Cybersecurity to the RescueIn order to assist the targeted victim and recuperate the stolen cryptocurrency, cybersecurity expert Denley took advantage of the fact that the database was open for both read and write, and searched the entries for the specific collections; he then ran the keys through his custom sweeper, and began his analysis of tracing the stolen cryptocurrencies.Denley was able to retrieve the phished information from the scam artist’s open data and he ran it through his sweeper. This in turn allowed him to recover some of the stolen crypto funds.On top of assisting the victim, Denley also uncovered other malicious domains targeting cryptocurrency investors.With his software in place, Denley was able to deduce that the victim address belonged to an investor that used Binance, and so he reached out to the coin exchange. He then communicated with the victim and retransferred the recovered cryptocurrencies to the user’s new wallet address. Finally, he provided the crypto investor with some safety guides, to protect against future digital asset attacks.Crypto Theft on TwitterTheft of cryptocurrency is a lot more common now, with the rise in popularity of Bitcoins and altcoins. Just recently, a massive Bitcoin scam attack erupted on Twitter’s social platform and consequently, the verified accounts of numerous celebrities, tech moguls such as Elon Musk and Bill Gates, and political figures were seized. This mass attack stirred a lot of motion within the social media community, as scam artists were able to get away with at least $100, 000 worth of Bitcoins.Twitter is now still working on uncovering the identities of the hackers, and they have apologized for the inconveniences and security breaches this outbreak has caused.",2020-07-27 08:30:00,"blockchain, bitcoin, altcoins, theft, cryptocurrency, binance, cybersecurity, cybercrime, twitter, twitter hack",Shine Li,"Bitcoin, AI","10|10,000|Bill Gates|Binance CollaborateIn|DApp|Denley|Elon Musk|Harry Denley|MetaMask|Twitter|TwitterTheft|Ui|at least $100"

12709,https://cryptoslate.com/heres-why-dave-portnoy-is-already-selling-his-bitcoin-chainlink-and-orchid/,https://cryptoslate.com/,2,NaN,"Here’s why Dave Portnoy is already selling his Bitcoin, Chainlink, and Orchid","On Aug. 13, Barstool Sports’ founder Dave Portnoy finally dived into Bitcoin and crypto after playing with the idea for a number of weeks. Portnoy, who has become a celebrity day trader since the pandemic began, got help from the Winklevoss Twins — Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss, co-founders of the Gemini crypto exchange and Bitcoin billionaires — to enter the market. The video showing Winklevoss Twins helping Portnoy buy Bitcoin and Chainlink (LINK) was one that went crypto-viral, garnering over a million views. As funny as it was, Portnoy was quick to make money. In the three days after he bought his coins, the Barstool founder was purportedly up tens of thousands of dollars on his initial $250,000 investment. Unfortunately, his luck has run out. The celebrity day trader, who touts nearly two million followers on Twitter, announced on Aug. 21 that he is folding out of the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market — potentially for good. Dave Portnoy liquidates Bitcoin and altcoin holdings in publicized fashion Portnoy’s crypto career began with a bang: he purchased Bitcoin and Chainlink with the help of some of the most famous people in the space and he secured sponsorship from BlockFi. His crypto career is seemingly ending with a whimper, though. On the morning of Aug. 21, he noted that he now owns zero “bitcoins,” referencing all cryptocurrencies and citing his losses in this nascent market: “I currently own zero bitcoins. I will wait and watch. I lost 25k. Just like with the stock market it took my brain time to figure it out. I know this. The Link Marines are weak and the orchid flowers do die in the crypto world. I may or may not be done.” I currently own zero bitcoins. I will wait and watch. I lost 25k. Just like with the stock market it took my brain time to figure it out. I know this. The Link Marines are weak and the orchid flowers do die in the crypto world. I may or may not be done. #bitcoin — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) August 21, 2020 He added in an edition of his daily trader livestream that he’s out of the crypto market not because Bitcoin went down, but because his holdings in Chainlink and Orchid (OXT) dropped massively. He added that he thinks the “LINK Marines” are the “worst army out there,” referencing the funny term given to proponents of the altcoin. “I’m getting killed with Bitcoin — I’m down now on my bitcoins. Listen, it took me months to figure out the stock market… But I don’t have the time to f**k around with crypto… You LINK Marines are a bunch of f**ing frauds — you guys keeping on dumping this, not pumping it.” Portnoy added that he may leave the cryptocurrency market for good, but seeing that Bitcoin could continue rallying to the upside, it is unclear if the investor will give up those potential gains. He’ll stick to stocks For the time being, the celebrity day trader will be sticking with stocks, which he jokes can only go up. Portnoy quipped in response to a Chainlink-themed Twitter account impersonating Tyler Winklevoss: “I make 6 figures a day like clockwork in the real stock market. No need to sit around losing money waiting for Elon to mine gold from outer space. I’ll have built my own house on the moon before that day comes. If I wanna lose 7 figs on wives tales ill stick with the track.” Mentioned in this article Orchid Chainlink BlockFi Tyler Winklevoss Cameron Winklevoss Posted In: Bitcoin, Adoption, Edge Ad CryptoSlate on X x.com/cryptoslate Get the latest crypto news and expert insights.

In addition to leading equity financing, NYDIG will also cooperate with Luxor on many mining-related companies and computing power-based products.Luxor's CEO and co-founder Nick Hansen believes that this strong cooperation will completely change the use, valuation, trading, and hedging methods of hashrate and provide miners with the best products and services.The function of hashrate generally measures the processing power of the Bitcoin network.The co-founder and CEO of NYDIG, Robert Gutmann, stated that:""We're confident in Nick's vision and his team's ability to drive and expedite the hashrate migration to North America, and the development of instruments that can strengthen the Bitcoin ecosystem.""The proprietary technology developed by Luxor has the potential to increase returns for miners. Luxor's Switch software product is a profit-switching algorithm that maximises the rewards of computing power by switching between the blockchains and the venues.Bitcoin miners are in pain due to the price crash cutting into their profit margins. Since the start of Elon's tweets on May 12, the hash rate has dropped, and their miner wallet net flows have been increasingly turning negative.To help miners increase their returns, Luxor provides a software solution called Switch that uses a profit conversion algorithm to maximise computing power rewards by converting blockchains and venues to obtain the highest revenue.According to Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, the rate of China's dominance has dropped from 65% to 55% since April 2020, which indicates China's dominance is weakening, while the United State's dominance is increasing, accounting for 11% due to China's authority strengthen and tighten legal restrictions on cryptocurrency mining activities.As previously reported by Blockchain.News, Bitcoin miners from the Chinese regions of Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, and others are beginning to sell off their mining hardware to not step into the red line of the law.",2021-06-10 10:00:00,"blockchain, bitcoin, luxor, nydig, series a funding, miners, mining",Annie Li,"Bitcoin, AI","$5 million|$5M Series A Funding|11%|65% to 55%|Blockware Solutions|Cambridge|Celsius Network|China|Chinese|DPO|Elon|Inner Mongolia|Luxor|NYDIG|NYDIG - Blockchain|Navier|Nick|Nick Hansen|North America|Robert Gutmann|Seattle|Sichuan|Switch|bitcoin|luxor|nydig,|the United State's"

The trust fund has received worth more than $1.3 millionBTC donationswithin three weeks of the trust's launch.""Charity: water"" is a non-profit organization founded in 2006 that aims to bring clean and safe drinking water to people in developing countries.The Bitcoin Water Trust aims to directly bring drinking water to places currently inaccessible to solve the global water crisis.In order to draw greater attention from potential investors, the Bitcoin water trust established a new charity model called “HODL MODL”, which means “hold on for dear life”. The institution also announced that Gemini's cryptocurrency wallet would accept Bitcoin donations and continue this campaign until 2025. It intends to influence the use of Bitcoin will have a more significant impact on the future.

It brings the HODL ethos of Bitcoin to charitable giving, and means your bitcoin donation today could make an even bigger impact tomorrow.""""We’re thrilled to help a fellow mission-driven organization like charity: water accept bitcoin and maximize its humanitarian efforts,"" the post added.Currently, approximately 785 million people worldwide cannot access purified water. Co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have pledged to match the first 50 BTC donated to the Bitcoin Water Trust to provide clean water for approximately 50,000 people. Although this move can only help a small part of the world’s people get clean water, they believe that it will have a more significant impact on the people who could not access clean water through this trust. The institution also plans to spend Bitcoin in 2025 or buildclean water projects withmore than 20 countries or regions.Scott Harrison, CEO of charity: water, also revealed that:“We've been encouraged by the overwhelming support we have seen already for the Bitcoin Trust Initiative. By establishing this trust, we aim to harness the transformational power of this generational digital technology to make a lasting social impact, and in the process to provide a potential model for other charities who are working to do the same.""In recent months, since Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin donated more than $1.5 billion, the charity has become a hot topic in the crypto industry.Russian Canadian programmer and co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has donated a large chunk of his crypto holdings to fund various charity organizations.
